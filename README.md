Recipelah is a responsive recipe discovery web application developed as a student project. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, browse curated meals, and upload their own recipes, which are saved using browser local storage. The interface is built with Bootstrap and enhanced with JavaScript for dynamic rendering, modal views, and theme toggling.

The project demonstrates front-end development fundamentals, UI design principles, and client-side state management.
